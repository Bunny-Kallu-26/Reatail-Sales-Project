# Reatail-Sales-Project
This repository showcases a comprehensive retail analytics project, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive dashboard creation. The project involved:

Data Preparation: Loading, cleaning, and transforming a retail dataset using Python (Pandas) within a Jupyter Notebook. This included handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating new analytical features like Net_Revenue.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis and visualization using Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover key insights into customer satisfaction, top product categories by net revenue, and daily revenue trends.

Interactive Dashboard: Development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard (likely in Power BI, as discussed) featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue, Orders, Discounts, and Customer Satisfaction, supported by various visual charts and interactive filters.
